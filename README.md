- 👋 Hi, I’m @SeivaDArve
- 👀 I’m interested in ... accept colaboration invites (that is how I plan to learn, learn by request: "do this...", "do that..."; "try to do this or that...")
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bash > html > CSS > Javascript > Python > Django > SQL > Kotlin by developing a project that includes all of them called jarve (repository: jarve-ConfigManager). With this project I should be able to finish 2 certificates: LPIC-1 and "Harvard's Online CS50 Web Programming with Python and Javascript")
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything actually, that would mean I would have a team, and a team learns faster
