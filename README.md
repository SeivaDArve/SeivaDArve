- 👋 Hi, I’m @SeivaDArve
- 👀 I’m interested in ... accept colaboration invites (that is how I plan to learn, learn by request: "do this...", "do that..."; "try to do this or that...")
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bash > html > CSS > Javascript > Python > Django > SQL > Kotlin by developing a project that includes all of them called jarve, DRYa and nan-D (The repository: DRYa is the main focus, to whom every other app/repo connects too). With this project I should be able to finish 2 certificates: LPIC-1 and "Harvard's Online CS50 Web Programming with Python Sqlite3 and Javascript")
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything actually, that would mean I would have a team, and a team learns faster
- 📫 How to reach me ... flowreshe.seiva.d.arve@gmail.com or Instagram@dvsrodrigues


In love with:
- Vim flow

- Django
- Termux
- WSL2
- Kotlin
- Crossplatform and FOSS software
- Linux
- Sqlite3
- Emacs <3
- tmux
- the fact: Iron Man (Marvel) was a programer;)
- Raspberry Pi for home/life automation
- Arduino
- Bootable USB sticks with fully functional OS (and in sync)
- Meepo (Dota 2 game)

Looking for: Creating a CHEAP smartwatch simply to input values via bluetooth to Termux (terminal emulator on Android).
  Having a programable smartwatch or using a smartwatch as a peripheral would make my programming skills and vision to become super powerfull
  there is room for on more dev to join the team, are you up to the challenge? (flowreshe.seiva.d.arve@☻gmail.com)
